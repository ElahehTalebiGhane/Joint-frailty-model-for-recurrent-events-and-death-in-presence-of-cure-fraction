 by E. Talebi-Ghane*, AR. Baghestani*, F. Zayeri, V. Rondeau, A. Akhavan.

*For questions, comments or remarks about the code please contact E. Talebi-Ghane (e.talebi@umsha.ac.ir and talebi_ghane@yahoo.com).

*The code has been written using R-3.5.1 (platform: x86_64-w64-mingw32/x64, 64-bit) with package versions gaussquad_1.0-2 and compiler. 
*The data set  BreastCancersurgery_BiomJ.csv was utilized in this manuscript which can be found in subfolder data.
*Two functions for generating data (data.gen.gamma.R and data.gen.log.R) are provided subfolder function.


*To reproduce the results in order of the figure and tables in the manuscript, do the following steps:
	1. For figure 1, run "Fig1.Kaplan_Meier_Curve.R" which is located in the ".../code_and_data/master_program".  
	2. Table1-Table6  presented simulation results in manuscript. to reproduce these results:
		a) At the first step, the data should be generated by the programs in Simulation folder and will be stored in the paper subfolder. 
		b) At the second step,the programs that located in each subfolder (".../code_and_data/master_program/Table1-Table6") 
	   	   could be conducted and reproduce the simulation results.
   	       *** It is nessecary to state that each scenario was conducted for three sample size (100, 500 and 1000), hence their 
        	   program, their generated data and their results are saved seperately by sample size. 
	3.  Our proposed model was illustrated using a real dataset on patients with breast cancer in Table7. 
	    To reproduce this table, run "Table7.Application.R" which is located in the ".../code_and_data/master_program".  
	4.  To reproduce Table 1 in supplementary run Table1.supplementary.R in ".../code_and_data/master_program".
	5.  all results will be stored in result folder.
